## 2026-06-12 — attempt 1
- uploaded: False
- severity: high
- issues:
  - Major audio/transcript mismatch: The actual audio significantly diverges from the intended Hierocles quote. The narration adds extensive original content about fear, self-care, character, and friendship that is not part of the original quote.
  - The sequence structure suggests this is part of a multi-part series ('tomorrow Hierocles turns...'), but presented as a standalone quote attribution to Hierocles, which is misleading.
  - Text contrast issue: Some yellow/gold text on the cave/water background has marginal readability in certain frames, particularly in the mid-section.
  - Quote authenticity problem: The attribution to Hierocles is incomplete/inaccurate given the substantial narrative additions that frame and extend the original philosophical statement.

## 2026-06-12 — attempt 2
- uploaded: False
- severity: high
- issues:
  - Major audio/caption mismatch: Transcript shows the quote has been heavily modified and expanded with additional commentary about Heracles that is not in the original Hierocles quote. The actual spoken content differs significantly from the intended attribution.
  - Caption accuracy: The quote presented claims to be from Hierocles but the audio/transcript reveals added material about 'Heracles' and extended philosophical commentary that is not part of the original source material.
  - Text contrast issue: Yellow/gold text on red atmospheric background has marginal contrast in several frames, making reading difficult in places.
  - Misleading attribution: Attributing the expanded narration to Hierocles when much of the content appears to be editorial additions or from different sources.

## 2026-06-12 — attempt 3
- uploaded: False
- severity: high
- issues:
  - Major audio mismatch: Actual narration significantly differs from intended Hierocles quote. The video presents an expanded philosophical interpretation rather than the original quote.
  - Caption accuracy: Text overlays present a modified/extended version of the quote, not the original attribution.
  - Misleading attribution: The quote is credited to 'Hierocles' but the content and phrasing have been substantially altered from the historical source.
  - Sequence integrity: The vertical short strings together multiple philosophical statements that don't follow the original source material coherently.
